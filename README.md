# Football Shootout! - A five-a-side soccer sim
## Software Development Plan
### Purpose and Scope
#### Overview
This application is a simple yet fun game designed to simulate a real match experience for the user. The user is able to view the rules of the game and view the team details before entering the match menu.
The user is able to select a team that they will control and select the team controlled by the application before participating in a coin toss to determine who will kick-off. There are 5 phases of play in the match where the user can choose a team action which results in a goal or a turn-over of posession. If the scores are even after the 5 phases of play, the match enters extra-time whereby the user has one last chance to secure victory! This match experience can be repeated as many times as the user wants.

#### Target Audience
Football Shootout is aimed to provide entertainment for anyone who needs to waste some time and is appropriate for all age groups. The user does not need to have any knowledge of the rules of football to play as the rules are available in the main menu.
